    <h2>Grilled Turkey Leg</h2>
    <p> This spicy turkey leg is sweet and hotâ€”just like <br>
        the smoked turkey legs you get at the fair or theme park!</p>

    <h2>Ingrediemts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 liter) bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large sweet onion, sliced</li>
        <li>4 turkey legs</li>
        <li> tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon steak seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, mix the lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage, 
            sugar, hot sauce, red pepper, pepper, and onion. <br>
            Place the turkey legs in the mixture, and bring to a boil. Cook 30 to 45 minutes, <br>
            until the turkey has reached an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Remove onion slices from the mixture, and arrange on the prepared grill. P
            lace turkey legs over the onions. Drizzle with honey, <br>
            and season with steak seasoning. Cook, <br>
            tuning once, 20 minutes, or until a crisp browned crust has formed on the turkey legs.
